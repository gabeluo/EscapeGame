# EscapeGame
The game is a 3rd person stealth game made using assets from the Unity Asset store and developed with the help of a guide found on the Learn Unity website. All aspects of the scripting was coded by me. The guide that was followed to build the can be found here: https://learn.unity.com/project/john-lemon-s-haunted-jaunt-3d-beginner

The game features a character, temporarily named John Lemon for his unique head, who must escape the haunted house by escape the gazes of gargoyles and ghosts. Gargoyles are stationary enemies while ghosts roam through designated paths. The game features the use of a navigation mesh and waypoints to determine the pathing of the ghosts. Hitboxes are used to determine with the player has been seen by an enemy, with raycasting implemented to ensure that the player isn't being seen through walls.

The camera has been changed to being over-the-shoulder and controlled by a mouse, which gives a more immersive experience and increases the difficulty since it is harder to see where the ghosts are.
